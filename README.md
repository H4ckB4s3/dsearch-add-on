# Dsearch Opera Add-on

## Introduction
The Dsearch Opera Add-on provides a simple and efficient way to resolve web3 domains using web2 bridges. It supports ENS (Ethereum Name Service) and HNS (Handshake) domains, making it easy to access these decentralized domains through your browser.

## Features
- **Input Field for Domain Resolution:** Easily resolve ENS and HNS domains.
- **Automatic Domain Handling:** Automatically uses `hns.to` for HNS domains and `limo.eth` for ENS domains.
- **New Tab Resolution:** Opens resolved domains in a new browser tab.
- **Bridge Availability Check:** Checks the availability of the bridges (`hns.to` and `limo.eth`) on page load and updates the UI indicators accordingly.

## Installation
To install the Dsearch Opera Extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Opera and navigate to `opera:extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.

## Usage
1. Click on the Dsearch extension icon in your browser to open the popup. (Pin it for easy access)
2. Enter an ENS or HNS domain in the input field.
3. Click the "Go" button or push enter to resolve the domain. The resolved URL will open in a new browser tab.

## Code Overview

### HTML Structure
The extension consists of a simple HTML structure with an input field and a button.

### JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code handles the domain resolution logic and UI interactions.

#### Domain Resolution
The script listens for the button click, processes the input, and constructs the appropriate URL based on the domain type.

#### Checking Bridge Availability
The script checks if the `hns.to` and `limo.eth` bridges are online and updates the UI indicators accordingly.
